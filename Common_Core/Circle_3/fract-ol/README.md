# **Fract-ol**  
### All about fractals visalisation

The project here is using a premade library *mlx* that has been added to the project,  
That enable us to create a window and set the rgb color for each pixel.

The idea here is that we take the window as a visulaisation of the *Complex* plane.  
Then for each coordinate of the plane we check if a given sequence converge or not to 0
The rate at wich it converge will define the coloration.  

See the full [Project Subject](./en.subject.pdf)
for more details.
